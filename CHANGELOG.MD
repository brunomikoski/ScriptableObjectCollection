- Added a Addressables Sample project as well
- Added Reset Settings context menu option
- Added the Write Addressable Loading Methods toggle for the collection

### Changed
- Updated the visuals of the CollectionEditor again, make it a bit tighter and more readable
- Refactored the settings again _(sorry, some settings will be lost again)_ to make the system more extensible and easier to maintain, settings are now stored inside the .meta files, so it can be versioned but also keep changes between projects

## [2.3.0]
### Changed
- Refactored CollectionCustomEditor to use UI Elements, getting rid of multiple hacks to make it work with the IMGUI and Reorderable list
- Updated the visuals of the Collection Editor
- Advanced Options are now exposed by default, giving more clarify of what is going on
- Removed the editor only assets from the Collection (`generateAsPartialClass`, `generateAsBaseClass`, `generateAsStaticClass`), those are not stored on the SOCSettings file and versioned

- Collections now can be enforced to use Indirect Reference, this will show an error message if the collection is not using Indirect Reference

### Know issues
- Settings will not be automatically converted to the new SOCSettings file, settings like _(custom namespace, filename, or target folder)_ so you have to reconfigure those settings manually

## [2.2.4]
### Added
- Added Item Order Protection. Override the `ShouldProtectItemOrder` property in your Collection to disallow items being dragged or deleted.

### Fixed

## [2.1.3]
### Fixed
- Fixed scripts folder validation warning showing incorrectly when mirroring folder
- Fixed namespaces ending with dot


## [2.1.0]
### Added
- Introducing Generators (thanks @RoyTheunissen). The overall idea is to make it simple to generate Collection Items based on other rules, for instance Unity Scenes, Unity Tags, Layers and anything else you want,check the help wiki about how to use it:  https://github.com/brunomikoski/ScriptableObjectCollection/wiki/Generators

### Changed
- Ability to define if a class can be reordered/add/remove items by the collection

- Added sorting options for collections
- Added option to make the collection not reorderable
- Fixed issue with post processing and recent imported files

## [2.0.8]
### Changed
- Fixed a small typo in the package description.
- Since [2.0.3] the collection now uses the Editor for drawing the items on the collection, but this can cause some issues depending of how customized it is inside a ReorderableList, so you now can choose the item to use it or not by toggling the `Use Custom Editor` inside the advanced settings
- Upgraded the `CollectionCustomEditor` to use `BaseEditor`
- Updated `CollectionItemPicker<>` to use `IndirectReference<>` to store the items, since also contains the `LongGuid` reference to the Collection, allowing to work with multiple collections of the same time _(It should automatically upgrade to the new version automatically)_
- Added ability to compare `CollectionItemPicker<>` to a `IList<>` of the same type
- Other small fixes and improvements


## [2.0.7]
### Changed
- Moved `EditorPreference` to Runtime folder. It is safe and useful to be able to use it in runtime code.

## [2.0.6]
### Changed
- Added `IsValid()` method for indirect references
- Added more checks and logs for when regenerating guids and cleaning bad items from collection
- Fixed issue with `CollectionItemPicker` not respecting base type as the starting type
- Removed the `Application.isPlaying` check for when setting items dirt

### Removed
- Unused `ScriptableObjectForPreferences`

## [2.0.5]
### Changed
- Reverted the change where the `isExpanded` property would be shared between the collection editor and the property drawer.
- Renamed `ObjectType` to `TObjectType` to keep standardized
- Added `TryGetItemByName` for the `ScriptableObjectCollection.cs`
- Added extra safety methods for checking duplicated `Guids` on collections and collection items
- Properly implemented `CollectionItemPicker` `IEnumerator<TItemType> GetEnumerator()`

## [2.0.4]
### Changed
- Added boolean check for static generated files to improve performance
- Changed settings to be stored on ProjectSettings folder and be shared by subversion
- Fixed `CollectionItemPickerPropertyDrawer` to support multiple collections of the same type
- Other small optimizations and code formatting

## [2.0.3]
### Changed
 - Collection now uses the appropriated Editor for each CollectionItem when displayed on the Collection
 - Fixed expanded state not being saved on the Collection

## [2.0.2]
### Changed
 - Fixed editor only icons causing issue when the project recompiles during playmode.
 - Added option to disable automatically reloading of collection on the CollectionRegistry
 - Updated Labels from `CollectionItemPicker` to use black as the default interface
 - Added some helpers to help project upgrade
 - Added `[DrawAsSOCItem]` attribute to allow drawing of custom `ScriptableObjec` that implements `ISOCItem` as a CollectionItem, this is only necessary for unity versions bellow 2022, should not affect anything else.
 - Syncronize Assets button on the Collection will also perform a reload of the collection

## [2.0.1]
### Changed
- Refactored `CollectionItemPicker` to only use `LongGUID` and also the PropertyDrawer has been remade, now looks nicer ðŸ¤©
- Added multiple helpers to `CollectionItemPicker` to be used more like a label system/
- Added `ISOCColorizedItem` to allow coloring of the `CollectionItemPicker` on the inspector, I will expand this to other areas as well. 

## [2.0.0]
### Changed
- Fixed issue with name parser that would still treat digits as string and added to the final name
- Fixed issue with PropertyDrawer of indirect reference without attribute would cause a null reference
- Refactored the system to use ScriptableObject as a base class instead of `ScriptableObjectCollectionItem` now any `ScriptableObject` can be used as a collection item as long as implements the `ISCOItem` interface
- Fixed issue with `CollectionItemPicker` that would not work properly with `ScriptableObject` that are not in the same assembly as the `ScriptableObjectCollection`
- Added new buttons on CollectionRegistry to force guid validation on all items
- Reduced automatic collection guid reloading to reduce performance impact on larger projects
- Fixed issues with target scripts generation folder not being saved properly
- Minimum supported Unity version is now 2021 _(I'm DONE with 2020, its the worst unity ever ðŸ˜’)_


### Removed
 - Removed support for Addressables, it was not working properly and it was not being used by a lot of teams, I think the addressables support should be handled elsewhere.

### Breaking Changes
- If you used the Addressables integration `SOC_ADDRESSABLES_SUPPORT` be extra careful when upgrading
- The old string based guid system has been replaced for a lighter version `LongGuid`
- If you are using IndirectReferences all the references will be lost, you will need to re-set them

### Changed
- Removed the automatically reload of CollectionRegistry using the `DidReloadScripts` callback, this caused multiple issues on batch mode and on clear libraries
